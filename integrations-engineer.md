Integrations Engineer
===========================

Flubit is looking for an integrations engineer to help build out our ability to integrate third party services with our [Merchant API] (https://dev.weflubit.com).

We already integrate with a number of eCommerce solutions, including Magento, OpenCart, Linnworks and Storefeeder. 

You will be working a part of the web services engineering team to write the code that will connect the WeFlubit API to other eCommerce APIs. You should be well adversed at implementing against complex APIs, dealing with confusing errors and fighting unpredictable network conditions.

Here are some things that we consider critical to being successful in this role:

##### Skills:
* You're a good programmer. You write understandable code with an eye towards maintainability and documentation.
* You have experience with modern PHP development (ideally with the Symfony framework).
* You are a strong communicator. Explaining complex technical concepts to managers and engineers is no problem for you.
* You know the difference between SOAP and REST. You know networking, HTTP and JSON/XML and what a good API looks like.
* You understand security concepts and can put them into action to protect our merchants and customers.
* When things break you are eager and able to help fix things.
* You have familiarity with a wide variety of software development methodologies, tools, languages and approaches.
* You are someone that others enjoy working with due to your technical competence and positive attitude.
* You have at least two years software development experience, a large portion of which has been in a team environment.

##### And it would be great if you also had:
* An academic background in computer science (BSc or MSc).
* Prior experience with or knowledge of eCommerce software platforms.
* Experience in rapidly moving startup environments.
