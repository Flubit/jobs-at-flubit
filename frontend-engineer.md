Frontend Engineer
===========================

Flubit is looking for a talented frontend software engineer who will be responsible for implementing new features on flubit.com, skucloud.co.uk as well as internal applications along with optimising and scaling these to their fullest potential. 

A significant portion of the role will involve you working on our newly relaunched flubit.com - the entire website is built using Angular 4, Typescript, RxJS and Webpack. 

You will have the opportunity to work with cutting edge technology; flubit.com has already AOT and Lazy Loading you can be the one transforming flubit.com into a PWA.

You will spend most of your time doing what you love - coding. We work in scrum cycles of two weeks, but we are not too rigid. We also have daily stand-ups with all the developers which makes it easier for you to have an overview of what's happening in the company.

As for your responsibilities, we are looking for someone who can take ownership of their code, who has an active attitude.

You need to be comfortable with your JavaScript. Angular experience is preferred, but we are really looking for problem solvers and not framework lovers.

You will have an active voice - we expect you to contribute with feedback. You will be working closely with product managers, your manager, colleagues from different teams and even with the CEO.

Ultimately, you must fundamentally believe in quality code as the only acceptable code.

You’ll relish code reviews as a feedback mechanism that helps you and your team improve and will have enough experience of working this way to tell us why you believe in it.

Given our growth, there's projections for you to grow your career alongside with us.
